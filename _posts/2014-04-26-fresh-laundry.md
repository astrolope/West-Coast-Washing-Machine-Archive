###Love & Light’s new album “Shift Happens” on Simplify Recordings

Midtempo glitch duo and chock full of love, Matt Madonna and Ryan Anderson, are releasing a basket full of fresh beats on Cinco de Mayo 2014. Currently on tour with musical genius Psymbionic, they are releasing “Shift Happens”, a beautiful eight track blend of breakbeats and a healthy dose of funky glitches you can always count on from these masters. You can’t help but want to get down to this whole album.

### The Rinse
It starts with an almost hauntingly subdued vocal sampling and a little eastern flair on ‘Day Won’ and moves through so many flavors of grittiness that Love & Light are so well known for, yet keeping the whole album to a fine tuned smoothness. They bring that bouncy glitch hop sound to the remaining tracks in almost ‘Infinite Possibilities’, stepping up the sound wave dimensions almost geometrically in ‘Key-O’Metric Saturns’ and ‘Pinion Jumper’ then bringing down the funk through ‘A Filter Fish’ and ‘Resilience’. In the end this whole album is exactly as the sample on the last track states: “99% percent of it is ‘About Love.’”

Get a taste of this album on the remaining stops on their spring tour with Psymbionic as they come back through Washington, Oregon, California, then onto a couple stops in Colorado and Arizona, you won’t be disappointed!
