### New Release From Glitch-Maestro Cheshire!

Starting out with a real funky 1950’s feel Cheshire’s latest load of brights takes you on a journey through some of the most fun one can have whilst on the dancefloor, driving in the car, or well...doing the laundry. I can say from the first minute of listening to this one, I am more than stoked to put these tracks into rotation. With collaborations with so many other very talented individuals, this album is stuffed full of goodness like that backpack of clothes and fresh socks you’re taking with you to Electric Forest.

### Breakdown

With cameos from Warp9, Blunt Instrument, Crazy Daylight, and Slynk, well...you just can’t go wrong with picking this one up today. Fresh offering on Beatport via Adapted Records. This whole album just reminds me of listening to those fresh jazzy beats on my dad’s hi-fi as a kid. From ‘Rock Me’ to ‘Sing It’ this whole album can justifiably be considered a must listen for all generations that want to get funky! ‘I Don’t Mind’ gives a new spin on a classic get down electric slide vibe. ‘Clark Kent’ comes in strong with some hip-hoppy vocals from Gad Man Dubs giving you the confirmation that the inspiration may well have come from the decades of the James Brown’s and George Clinton’s of the music world. ‘Come Baby’ comes in hot with a sample of K7’s (of TKA) ‘Come Baby Come’ in just the right tone to continue on with that awesome jazzy feel with that dose of scat.

### Continued...

Keep your ears open for the natural world getting funkafied in ‘Bird Song’ where you’ll just want to move your feet with all of the birds out there this spring, you can’t help but want to jump on the wire with them and bounce around to this one. The title track brings us back to the 90’s a bit with a little taste of Bloodhound Gang’s ‘Bad Touch’ and then just throws you into a blender of insanity and throws in a smidgen of sax to round it all out. ‘Sing It’ slows it down a bit and gives you that jam that rounds out the whole album in one neat little package of sweetness. All in all, ‘Simply Lifted’ is a must have for anybody who wants their upcoming summer to be one to be remembered.
