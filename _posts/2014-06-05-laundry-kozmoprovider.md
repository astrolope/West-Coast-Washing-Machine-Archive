### Kozmo x ProvideR release "Metropolis."
GlitchHop-EDM.com's Soundcloud feature of Kozmo and Providers new track is a treat to the ears. With a playfully distorted melody and a classic saw wave bassline. The tracks busy feel accompanies it's name as the minimal intro quickly breaks into freeway speed guaranteed to get you to the dry cleaners on time.

###Making Waves~
Kozmo's presence in Washington this summer is only growing and these are two names you definitely need to keep an eye out for. The soundcloud hype on this track from just this morning is awesome and it's an honor to be able to rinse even more of these tracks in the future!

### New updates!
I've added an Events page in the sidebar. If you've never clicked the little hamburger button on the top-left of the page it'd be a good time to do so and explore some of the other pages of the site! We also have our social media links stashed in there so feel free to listen to the WCWM feed on soundcloud as well featuring all this music in one great playlist!
