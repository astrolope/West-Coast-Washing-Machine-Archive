### What Just Happened?
So i'm sitting here in the recording booth getting ready to crush down a marathon session of choir concertos thinking about the events of this pass week and how to move forward with the ever present event slump.. What an amazing week for Washington really though. Atomic Reactor and kLl sMtH blew the top off every event that we visited and it was more than a blessing to be able to take what we've been working on to the road for some great crowd-sourced feed back. So much love in every city we stopped upon and it only made me more excited for what we have to bring to you in the future, and for my own accord of hitting the studio and cranking out all these unfinished tracks from my next hopefully last summer E.P. :)

### Nexties?
On the plate for the upcoming weeks I wanted to finish scripting a gallery system and fix some of the little things that have been bothering me on the WCWM. Continuing working on our formatting for podcasts that's been coming along slower than i'd like. It's okay folks it'll be a good wait, we promise. Dialing my summer set and getting a nice mix that I could feature on here as well for you fine peoples. I also have a few guest writers and some testimonials to be adding so the content can continue to be what you want it to be! I'd like to dial some sort of nifty contact form as well. Along with some disqus comments at the bottom of the index thread. Just click that comment button they're there!

### In summary~
Not a big update just some things that have been rolling around in my head for a bit that I didn't really want to gurgitate onto facebook! A huge heap of thank yous to everyone that came and helped prep our property spot for this last event and the fantastic future events we have planned for you! All the people that hit the road with us and made sure that our family was well represented in the cities that we visited. Especially Bellingham and Spokane!  A round of thank you's to the artists and everyone thats creativity is what inpsires us to keep doing this all together and push it further everyday.

### Oh.. Wait!
I also updated the new featured mix with Soululars mix for Space Bounce radio! Peep the mix and more at [Soulular on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/Soulular).
