### Cloud-D "Light Fracture"

For the past 6 years, Cloud-D has been crafting himself into one of the premier bass engineers Denver, Colorado has to offer. With support from The Mile High Sound Movement, Family Moons, HBC, and the rest of underground bass movement, Cloud-D has made his name known amongst bass enthusiasts around the nation. Earlier this July, Cloud-D released an all original Album titled 'Light Fracture' available for free download via [@bandcamp](http://cloud-d.bandcamp.com/) and [@soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/cdmusic).

Cloud-D's original style and fantastic low end takes you on a Bass Ship ride filled with purple lazer womps, galactic goodness and smooth hip-hop drum beats. From start to finish this album is an elegant masterpiece of low end love from above. As the Astroproflex launches you into the Clouds Over Zion, you can take a moment and enjoy the Lemonwaves of the Light Fracture shooting from the Space Needlez. . . that's some real Space Shit.



This 9-track Album is must hear album for bass music lovers everywhere. Follow [Cloud-D on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/clouddbass) to stay up to date on upcoming shows and future releases. Make sure to see Cloud-D Live this summer/fall its a "WCWM Must See Act of 2014"


Thank you come again,
