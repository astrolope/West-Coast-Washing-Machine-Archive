## Ian Ewing

Ian Ewingâ€™s music is a combination of lush, crisp sounds with a little hint of hip hop sewn in there. He accompanies all that with full, balanced and well designed bass that caresses you and leaes you with an uplifting feeling. His tracks range from smooth, groovy and jazzy to up beat pop synth with gangster vocals and is able to weave in sexy silk everywhere. If your looking for some clean music and got some free time, drop by his soundcloud and check out his wares.
