###WHAT IS The Mile high sound movement?
>The Mile High Sound Movement is an artist collective in Colorado dedicated to gathering unique and original art and music and exposing it to the world. We promote local artists, organic and original art from different regions, home-grown musical projects who all showcase their talents in every way imaginable and bring them onto a stage, and into the public eye. Our top priority is to make every single party different with the intent to build strong bonds with friends old and new to create a family with a foundation built on the community and support. The Movement is passionate not only about music but about self-expression and organic art in all of the various forms and manifestations. With a focus on originality and deep personal investment in ones art, The Mile High Sound Movement is at the forefront of the booming West Coast electronic music movement.

Rather than pick and choose my favorite highlights I think I'll leave that up to you folks this time. With far too many of my favorite artists to pick and choose I wanted to leave the highlights to the true collaboratory effort of this compilation and let you guys decide which tracks you like the most! Perhaps you could write about it in the comments and tell us about which track you enjoyed the most. Or, just do the write thing and jump on over to bandcamp to get this great comp.
