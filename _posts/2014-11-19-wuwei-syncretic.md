Wu Wei's new release on Muti Music titled "Syncretic" fuses a delightful element of tribal landscapes with the misty mountains of northern California. Laid atop variable downtempo beats this release creates a wonderful soundtrack to this rainy day and our next edition of Fresh Laundry with Wu Wei.

###Bio
>Wu Wei, a name derived from the Taoist path of non-action, has tapped into a universal song and brought its melodies into the physical realm. The result is a uniquely unifying effect, transcending language and cultural identity to remind the rest of humanity of their fundamental unity. The 21-year-old Los Angeles to Humboldt County transplant has spent his recent years perfecting his attenuation to the rhythms of the natural world creating intentional music to bring the planet together. He strives to combine the soul reaching sounds of ambient IDM together with the earthy bass of futuristic world hip-hop. He adds in a mix of orchestral instruments with the liberating sounds of nature to bring his music home and to keep in synch with the soul of the world. His production skills are only part of this terrestrial-magicianâ€™s slew of crowd charming concoctions. His DJ prowess creates connection to the dancers and alignment to the commonality of movement. -- Tooesday Behr

###Highlights
Upon first listen of this album I was met with the delightful trickling of streams, birds chirping, and the organic accompaniment of strings and ancient drums painted a rainforest scene amongst the walls. The opening track "Asanga's Path" leads us into the forest with a beckoning call breaking through into a mellow stroll through the remaining five tracks. I have a feeling this one will be getting some serious playtime in the near future. As "Icarus" and this musical journey come to a close. The playful melody reminds me of the time that i've spent in our west coast rainforest amongst the shrill birds and misty trees.
