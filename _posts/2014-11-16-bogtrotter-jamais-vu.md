Coming from Minnesota, Bogtrotter, holding it down from multiple angles. Naming his EP 'Jamais Vu'. 

###Flip side

Quite the opposite of deja vu, it is something like experiencing events that hit a certain note in your limbic lobe, while still feeling so unprecedented. Much like entering a psychedelic space, with feelings of being free and at home, yet having no idea where you currently are in the other realm.

Tearing the seams between each dimension with crashing waves of deep extraterrestrial wobbles, rhythmic bass lines, and mind accelerating arpeggiation. Definitely fancying my pineal gland.

These vibrational patterns... jamais vu.

I think my favorite track on this EP is 'Parallel Universe'. I feel it singing to my roots like an effervescent bird in the morning, bound to the sun rising. Get this EP while you can, it is free to download on [Bandcamp] (http://bogtrotter.bandcamp.com/album/jamais-vu). So juicy.

So this is what the other side is like... No decadence here fellas...
