After seeing Mr. Rogers perform at CCF festival this year I was in absolute excitement to hear what his next release would hold. After a wait of many months his new project PEGA5U5 releaased an album called "The Flock" featuring an array of my favorite tracks from his set. 

###First Thoughts
On the inital listen the opening track "Get Low" hold true to everything you love about Dusty's music. With Agustus on the rhymes and leads reminiscient of some of your favorite Mr. Roger's tracks the sounds that are eminating from my speakers fill the room with utmost spatial enjoyment. Notable tunes including "Just Keep Swimming" with a catchy vocal hook that instantly reminds you of Dori from Finding Nemo. 

###"Get Low"
