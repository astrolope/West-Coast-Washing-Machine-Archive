"The solo project of bumble is a hive of vibrations set into the air by an infatuation of audio play. 
Weaving sonically diverse, bass wobbling, funk centered, glitchy creations. 
The unifying theme of his music reflect nature, experience, perception and aspires to spark connection."

### Buzzin with Bumble
April 1st, Bumble came out with a new release on [Additech.com](http://www.addictech.com/p/182477) that he put out with Shanti Planti, and oh my is it amazing. Fell in love with it the moment it hit my ears. This stuff is the perfect mix of grooviness and tangible ambient space. The release came packed with twelve mind-blowing tracks, and with ten creatively inspiring voice inserts, an innovative idea. Something great about this music is Bumble's use of instruments, it is pretty extraordinary, rhythmic dopeness. In the track 'Binary Fission' you might find yourself fluttering about on the dancefloor with everyone in the crowd acting as a gear, spinning with precision and torque. 

Raw stuff.

### Favorite Track
Of course everyone has their favorite song in an EP or album right?

Mine would be: [Tsunami's](http://www.addictech.com/p/182504)
This stuff gets so weird, I love it.

We hope that Bumble comes out with some more of this soon. Top notch!!!

Thank you so much for honoring us with your music all the way from Australia, majorly inspiring.
