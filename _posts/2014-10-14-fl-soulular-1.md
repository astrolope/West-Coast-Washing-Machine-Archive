### Soulular releases EvoLuminate on Bandcamp!

Donning my cup of coffee and subpac I nestled in for Jeff's latest refinement in low-end expeditions. After hearing the "Livity" teaser on Soundcloud the other day I was quite excited to give the rest of these tracks a play-through.

###First Impressions.
At first listen the opening track "Levels" takes you through a myriad of emotions and layers. The soft horn-esque leads are guaranteed to give you the "feels". Peeling away the layers even deeper the next tracks delve into a deep dancehall reggae dub gangster typa way. With some particular exciting sounds that woke my groggy 9 A.M. ass right up. The closing track "Soft Puddles" fades away into a dreamy reminiscient making me wonder if I actually just did all of this or am I going to wake up and start my morning routine all again.
