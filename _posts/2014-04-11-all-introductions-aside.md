### Welcome
Hey all you music lovers, please keep your eyes peeled for a new music blog collab from [LYCRA.beats](http://lycrabeats.com) and Stark Raving Rad Productions. This will be a project of epic proportions as epic as that pile of laundry you have after festie season! We will be teaming up to sort, wash, dry, fold, and put away the tracks we find that look good, smell good, sound good, and just plain feel good!

### The Vision
This project is called the 'West Coast Washing Machine'. It will include reviews of the latest EP, LP, and single drops in our blog column 'The Hamper'.  You can also look forward to our podcasts which will bring together our fellow producers and DJâ€™s, each of whom will be an honorary member of the Lost Sock Dynamos, taking you through that spinning portal where all of the lost socks travel. Bringing you one-off guest mixes, exclusive interviews, and the ubiquitous loose change we find after a load of musical laundry. Each blog and show will have as many sights and sounds as the clothing you find in your vehicle after two week trip to Burning Man. We look forward to sharing our homies music with you in an easy to navigate platform. We will gift to you a closet full of mixes with tracks specifically selected by the Lost Sock Dynamos sorted out into every genre and style you can imagine.

Thanks for stopping in and check back in the near future for some exciting new updates!
