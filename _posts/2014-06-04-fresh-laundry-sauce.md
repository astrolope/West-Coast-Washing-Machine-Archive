###LYCRA.beat's round-up of awesome releases.

There's been way too much awesome music for me to even think of keeping up on all of this whilst managing my own productions and design work. Luckily I have an awesome team that usually pulls through on the best music released everyday. Sometimes I feel like I slack a little bit though and I do have huge lists of music to share. So this post is going to be a soundcloud embed round-up of all my favorites releases this week!

###sAuce x kLL sMTH releases "Make Love to Silence"
Getting hype from EDM.com and being released through [Ravish & Blap](http://www.ravishandblap.com) this release by Denver natives Caleb and Kris is making some sexy waves for the recent release round-up and everywhere else for that matter! Coming out tonight at 6p.m. MST. It's first track is currently up for stream on soundcloud today culminating to a bandcamp "Pay What you want" download tonight!

Here's a soundcloud link to there title track "Make Love to Silence."

### That's it I guess.
I thought I had more to write about but I'm not really at liberty to release any info on anything else so I guess I'll wait. Coming up in July there may or may not be a mini tour with Cloud-D and Resonant Language ;) Stay ^ for a new mix and some more releases from Kozmo and Provider. Heard some news about a Professional Chillers E.P. In the works as well.
Enjoy folks! Don't forget to follow sAuce and kLL sMTH on soundcloud!
