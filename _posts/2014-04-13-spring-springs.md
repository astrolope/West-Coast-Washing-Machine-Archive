### The Nu-Nu
While Jellyfyst and Jibber are away at Lucidity Festival. I've had a fair deal of time to myself to really work on creating the blog space that we've all talked about and wanted to create. What started as ranting at Soundcloud songs in an office has been finally realised as its full potential... An opinated music blog. I've been scripting up a storm over the past few days and the blog has started to take its form to be in a soft-release phase to start formatting content and getting feedback. I'm proud to release this version to you folks as the first version of The West Coast Washing Machine!

### Fresh Content
We all like to write occasinally the mood strikes us and we can ramble on a string of adjectives and verbs that can rouse armies and create nations. Or.. Just shoot the shit. Here at The West Coast Washing Machine we're dedicated to bringing you relevant content to the music you like to hear. Are you tired of sifting through your Soundcloud news feed to no avail? Do you have no idea whats going on this weekend? Let us be your guides. It's not as terrifying as you may have thought and you may learn something new in the process.

### Simplicity
We want to keep things simple and community oriented by using open source blog software and a great team of resourceful individuals we want to hear from you regarding all matters of everything! Feel free to chime in if you like something, don't like something, want to change it, or just plain don't care. It's all about you guys and we want to keep that alive by keeping regular updates and fun interactive content.

This is just a little peek into the interviews, mixes, articles, and podcast's we have in plan to feature for you guys. Getting super excited for the launch!

Enjoy guys!
With love, LYCRA.beats~
