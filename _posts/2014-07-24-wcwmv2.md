### WCWM v2

Haven't made an update in a while but after toiling for many hours the newest version of the WCWM is closer to how I envisioned it when I started. I'm super excited to roll out this update and see what the next couple months holds for us over here at the Washing Machine. Coming up very soon we have The Pirate Party 2014 coming up! August 8-9th you can check more info on that in the Events tab now very easy to find! 

I also have a piling list of EP's to write about and a couple reviews and write-ups from guest writers I'd love to get formatted ASAP. Bring on the next wave of content! As the summer season starts to come to a near slow our team will be a little more gathered and I feel the regularity of our content will resume. But until then enjoy the new site and I hope to see you at our next event!
