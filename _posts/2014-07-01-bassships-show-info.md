### #BRICKSQUASHMONOPOLY Dates and Info

As we near closer and closer to the dates for Cloud-D and Resonant Languages Bass Ships and Snare Planes mini-tour I wanted to take a moment and remind us of the locations that we'll be visiting and where you'll be able to find us during the next week.

###7/9/14 - Bellingham, WA - Rumors Cabaret - 21+
In conjunction with Axis Events we're bringing our first stop to Bellingham for a one-off night of next-level glitch. With local DJ gone west-coast household name Humpfree Lowgart if you're feeling neglected on the squish this will surely satisfy your needs.
