### A serving of what!?
You heard correctly. Lazer Bagels and Scream Cheese. Proper noun maybe all caps, irrelevant. The term coined by Kristoffer Edland of [kLL sMtH](http://soundcloud.com/kllsmth) and part of the blap-duo 2NUTZ explains their sound in one very proper imagery of words. Flying Bagels with lazers, These words do nearly no  justice of the noises that this breakfast buffet of sound caters to your speakers. Imagine an atom, and then imagine that atom inside that other.. well. You get the idea. Enough with my lackluster description. turn up your soundsystem or put on those favorite pair of headphones and give these tracks a listen!

Starting May 14th in Bellingham, WA for a ground breaking mini-tour kick off with Jellyfyst, Macks.well, and LYCRA.beats. Axis productions is going to provide you with a night of cheap drinks and cutting edge tunes. The next night moves on to a private party in the Leavenworth Area providing festival type camping and top notch cascade mountain views.

Finally and last but not least we're going to be making a final stop on the 17th in Wenatchee, WA for an 18+ closer put on by veteran wenatchee production company Stark Raving Rad Productions. I'll place a list of the event links for facebook below were you can also find more information, music and ask questions even more directly!

### Some new releases!
There were a few good releases that I definitely don't want to let slip from anyones radar. One of the more exciting ones being news of a new Tipper release on Addictech Records available [here](http://www.addictech.com/p/159017) for presale. Also on Addictech this week - The other half of 2NUTZ, Atomic Reactor released his first full length album titled ['Android Soul'](https://soundcloud.com/atomic-reactor/sets/android-soul-addictech-records) featuring 17 varied tracks showcasing his refinement of production skills and exploration into the world of instrument sampling all making for one very enjoyable listen.

### What's coming next?
