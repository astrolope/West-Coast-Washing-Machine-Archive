   bio: 'Riley "Blapsta" McGowen has been fine tuning his art of guiding bass ships through uncharted sound waves of sexy hip-hop drums and organic leads since early 2012. Heavily influenced by artists Russ Liquid, Thirftworks, sAuce, Cloud-D, and more. He stands out as one of Central Washington's most talented young producers. Collaborating with local artists far and wide we are more than excited to see what Blapsta brings to the table in the coming years.'
